    "# How this filter works\n",
    "- 1. Assign `all_plugins.json` and to variable `all_plugins` to it\n",
    "- 2. Create `blacklist_list` dict\n",
    "  - 1. Get blacklist from `blacklist.json`\n",
    "  - 2. Since `blacklist.json` is a nested dict, only get the leaf arrays and aggregate them into a single array. Set this array to `blacklist_list`\n",
    "- 3. Assign `plugins_info.json` to variable `plugins_info`\n",
    "- 4. Initiate a dict called inital_screening. Execute an initial screening of plugins with the following loop:\n",
    "  - 1. Create a dict called `plugin_info` with the item `{namespace: plugin[\"namespace\"], image: plugin[\"manifest\"].get(\"logo_url\", None), description_for_human: plugin[\"manifest\"][\"description_for_human\"], description_for_model[plugin[\"manifest\"][\"description_for_model\"]], openapi_url: plugin[\"manifest\"][\"api\"][\"url\"]}`\n",
    "  - 2. Check if `auth` is `\"none\"`\n",
    "    - 1. If passes then add the following items to `plugin_info` to `{auth: false}`\n",
    "    - 2. If fails then add the following items to `plugin_info` to `{auth: true}`\n",
    "  - 3. Check that `namespace` is not it `blacklist_list`\n",
    "    - 1. If passes then add the following items to `plugin_info` to `{blacklisted: false}`\n",
    "    - 2. If fails then add the following items to `plugin_info` to `{blacklisted: true}`\n",
    "  - 4. Add `plugin_info` to `plugins_info` with key of the namespace\n",
    "- 5. Iterate through `plugins_info` and do the following:\n",
    "  - 1. Check if `plugin_info[\"openapi_url\"]` can be called without error\n",
    "    - 1. If passes then add the following items to `plugin_info` to `{whitelisted: true}`\n",
    "    - 2. If fails then add the following items to `plugin_info` to `{whitelisted: false}`\n",
    "- 6. iterate through `openplugin_classes` to do a complete prompted test.\n",
    "  - 1. generate a stimulous prompt to test the plugin\n",
    "  - 2. use stimulous prompt to see if plugin can be called without error\n",
    "- 7. Creaate a status for all plugins\n",
    "  - 1. all plugins start with status `unsupported`\n",
    "  - 2. if plugin `not openplugin_info[\"auth\"] and not openplugin_info[\"blacklisted\"] and openplugin_info[\"whitelisted\"]` then status is `tentative`\n",
    "  - 3. if plugin has `openplugin_info[\"stimulous_prompt\"] and openplugin_info[\"stimulated\"]` the status is `supported`\n",
    "- 8. Create a file called `openplugins_compressed.json` and save only plugins that are `tentative` or `supported`\n",
    "  - 1. Create a dict called `openplugins_compressed`\n",
    "  - 2. Iterate through `plugins_info` and do the following:\n",
    "    - 1. Check if `plugin_info[\"status\"]` is `tentative` or `supported`\n",
    "      - 1. If passes then add item {[namespace]: \"https://\" + openplugin_info[\"domain\"]} to `openplugins_compressed`\n",
    "- 9. create `PLUGINS.md` table based on `openplugins_compressed`"
